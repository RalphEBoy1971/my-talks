A list of topics I speak about on the different conferences, including posts, videos, slides etc. I track resources on my own, so maybe I'm missing smth.

---------------------

I'm working at [@cossacklabs](http://twitter.com/cossacklabs) on security products that provide strong, usable cryptography for busy people. Many things are open source, i.e. [Themis](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis) ‚Äî the crypto library for storage and messaging in mobile, desktop, and web apps, or [Acra](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra) ‚Äî database proxy with intrusion detection. 

I can assist you in protecting users data in your infrastructure, just drop me an [email](mailto:anastasi@cossacklabs.com).

I share a lot about my engineering life on twitter as [@vixentael](https://twitter.com/vixentael), and on [Medium](https://medium.com/@vixentael).

Enjoy! üîí

Before we get deep into protocols vulnerabilities: things you should remember designing your app flow from a security point of view.

This talk will focus on copybook headings of infosec: what you need to know before exciting stuff like cryptography and AI-assisted incident detection. Like, choice of data you show in the background mode, choice of 3rd party SDKs, which logs we send and where...

Even when developers create apps with security in minds, protect user secrets, and don‚Äôt reveal unencrypted data, attackers can find ways to bypass these security measures by exploiting architectural weaknesses and unobvious, yet very simple vulnerabilities. We will talk about all the tiny bits and pieces are necessary to make your app secure against simple attacks way before focusing on the hard things (like crypto).

1. Handling user secrets with care (showing, storing, logging).
2. Input validation and password rules.
3. Handling transport connection.
4. And some tips and tricks that will confuse attackers.

In-depth technical inquiry about cryptography in a wider context: how it helps to narrow more significant risks to controlled attack surfaces, enables managing the risk efficiently and elegantly, how tools and algorithms sit in a broader context of managing infrastructure-wide risks associated with handling sensitive data.

1. What is attack surface, how cryptography helps to narrow it. 
2. Simple crypto-systems, but significant downsides. 
3. Middleware-side encryption: protecting data in web-based infrastructures. 
4. Client-side encryption: trust to mobile apps and code execution. E2EE. ZKA. ZKP. 
5. Echelonization, and traditional techniques.

<img src="pics/crypto_owasp_preview.jpg" alt="Don't waste time on learning crypto" style="height: 466;"/>

Crypto in our lives: why you shouldn‚Äôt spend time learning all the details of the crypto-algorithms. Typical mistakes you make using crypto in your products. How to avoid late night commits, but to code 'fast and boring' instead.

1. The typical engineering workflow "we should protect the data, what shall we do", and possible mistakes. 
2. What is "boring crypto", what do we want from using crypto-products. 
3. Possible solutions: HSM / TPM / software crypto. 
4. How to select appropriate software crypto: libs, systems, containers. 
5. We want crypto to be similar to the Edison lamp: controllable and boring system.

## Blockchain solutions: the balance of safety and efficiency, or just a trend?

<img src="pics/blockchain.jpg" alt="Build it solve it" style="height: 466;"/>

The security engineer's job is to choose the appropriate solutions for the problems and to apply them. Discussing blockchain regarding cryptography is rather boring: it is simple, and even some assumptions in high-level protocols do not cause protests.

I will talk about the other side - where blockchain looks like an optimal strategy, where it causes questions. We will walk through the risk&threats models, trust, and guarantees, to the experience of using blockchain in the real project (and what happened next).

With intensifying threat access, snooping governments and insecure-internet-of-everything, the importance of zero-knowledge application architectures and end-to-end trust, for things more complicated than simple messaging, becomes more and more obvious for the app developers.

We will talk about real-world problems that ZKA fights against, learn typical cryptographic designs and progress in different spheres of ZKA. We will find out how to make data sharing, user collaboration on data in the cloud with your app provably secure.

<img src="pics/keys_preview.jpg" alt="Keys" style="height: 466;"/>

We will talk about building trust. Trust is built around various trust tokens: keys, passwords, secrets, biometric properties, things you have and things you know. We will talk about what should you trust, how to establish and verify trust, how to share trustedly among different users. We will discuss technical aspects: key exchange, key trust, key derivation, channel trust, multi-factor authentications. I will try to make the audience understand how this huge universe of tools and algorithms serves just one purpose: letting the right guys in, keeping the wrong guys outside our magical castle. And fairies there should be!

The idea was to share some knowledges about making more secure apps. We talked about:

- why SSL is not enough 
- strategies to implement SSL pinning 
- how to understand basic risks and threats of common mobile client-server infrastructure 
- protection methods against those threats 
- what is symmetric encryption; why we need it. where to store data and key. 
- what is transfer encryption; when we need it.

<img src="pics/uct_preview.jpg" alt="User centric trust" style="height: 466;"/>

We will talk about building security, that does not fail when application keys are exposed; when servers are hacked; security that lasts as long as unique user's crypto keys (or passwords) are safe. Putting secrets known by the user to be a source of trust is the ultimate way for an app to become "thin" in relation to the security model, thus lowering the risks and developer pain. We will learn about thin transparent security layers system and its applicability in client-server systems.

Everyone is talking about developers' specialization. 'Know you niche'. We have separate conferences for every dev area now: mobile, cloud, big data, iOT. In order to build a modern multiplatform mobile app you need to work with separate iOS and Android dev teams, separate backend dev team, designers and managers. Doesn't look too much?
 
I'll talk about another way of organization: multiskilled dev team, experience and benefits.

Mobile platforms present both new threats and new opportunities for system security. This presentation deals with modern approaches: how to protect data, which trust relationships emerge with mobile phone, how they affect traditional security layouts. How mobile phones dictate important client-server relationships.

But, what‚Äôs more important, we talk about making these things a consistent system: how to think to pick the right tools, which architectural patterns enforce security and minimize risks by design. We learn about ideas of echelonized defence, compartmentation and risk control. We finish with understanding where we stand right now: in security landscape that is rapidly changing, and mobile‚Äôs role in it is both dangerous and very important.
